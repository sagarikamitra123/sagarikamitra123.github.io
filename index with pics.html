        Hi this is Sagarika. I am from Kolkata Bengal India.
        I have a master degree in computer applications.
        For the past 12 years, Iâ€™ve been working at WBSEDCL, where I joined as an
        Assistant engineer & was later promoted to the post of Division Engineer.
        Under S&LP dept., I am responsible for identifying any loss making 
        practices of WBSEDCL and exploring avenues of loss prevention. 
        Currently my job profile is managing software projects, and I
        make sure everything runs smoothly in terms of business goals, 
        team collaboration, user acceptance testing (UAT), training and demo.
        I am concerned with the entire process of assessing project viability 
        to its operational use. Completed several projects over the years in my career:
        1.	Migration of legacy billing system to SAPISU system, 
        2.	Migration of local HVCMS server to data center,
        3.	Meter serialization software module, 
        4.	Seal tracking software module,
        5.	S&LP activity module, 
        6.	Recording maximum demand in meter reading, 
        7.	Regularising consumers with load overdrawal in billing. 
        
        Also I am in charge of the functioning & maintenance of HVCMS application: 
        requirements gathering, design and server monitoring. Further, I am also
        generating and analysing reports related to CCCs consumer energy 
        consumption patterns/ study variations point out loss prone areas & possible theft of electricity.
        My hobbies are full stack web development and travelling.
